#Ansible Provisioning for Vanilla Forums

This project began life as a [basic shell script](https://github.com/jerrywardlow/vanilla-qa/tree/Shell) for automated provisioning of a server to run the Vanilla Forums web app, then morphed into this weird complex thing that involved a Bacula backup server. Now in it's third life, it is a demonstration of Ansible configuration management for a Vanilla web server and MySQL database. It's a work in progress, but you probably already figured that out.
